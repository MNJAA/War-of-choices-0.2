# War-of-choices-0.2
A simple text game, Let the user enter his name and play in a specific rule in the story of the game and what happened depends on what he do or say 

I got the idea from ( dataquest.io ) while I was reading about python projects and I thought it would be nice to mention them, very helpful site for both beginners and pros

The idea of first story " Betrayed at dawn: Your quest for vengeance " I got it from two friends of mine and used ChatGPT to make it better and give me choices to put it and write me the scenario 

and coding on me (: 

I made this thing to improve my coding skills, though I think I can do better but the idea is cool and who knows maybe I'll learn something new


Edit: Actually I learned a lot \(^_^)/
